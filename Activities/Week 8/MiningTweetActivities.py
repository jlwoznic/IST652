# Joyce Woznica
# Week 8
#Mining Tweets Activity

#Using whatever search function that you like, 
#collect at least 20 tweets that discuss some aspect of coronavirus 
#that had a low number of retweets <10 
#and at least 20 tweets that had a high number of retweets >100. 

#Display some of the tweets with info about date, user, message, and number of retweets.

#You will report these tweets after breakout groups are over.

#Repeat this process on another topic of your choice.

#I have uploaded the program files needed to do this: 
#(found in files section  Week8Activity.zip)

#    DB_fn.py   (to save data to a DB and to load data from a DB)
#twitter_login_fn.py  (to login to twitter - you will need to add your 
#access info)
#    Get-Tweets.ipynb  (program to setup your requests and pull some 
#tweets)
#        You will need to modify the arguments to setup your topic and 
#            where you want to store them.
#    arg1 = hashtag to retrieve
#    arg2 = number of tweets to retrieve
#    arg3 = mongoDB to save the tweets in
#    arg4 = name of the collection in the mongoDB
